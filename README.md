<h1>REACT APP</h1>

<h2>PART 3: Using react, add search to filter employees by name.</h2>

<p>I have created react app independently because of some hosting issues in my server.So, I couldn't installed it inside Drupal codebase.</p>
<p>I have enabled RESTful web services module inside Drupal and created one view with rest export to get JSON data and made an API using views.</p>
<p>In react, I have used Axios package to get the data from api endpoint to displayed it in home page.</p>

<p>Based on the typing name, it will show results based on first name using react.</p>
